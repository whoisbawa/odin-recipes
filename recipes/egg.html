        <h1><strong>Description</strong></h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        A delicious runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these.

        <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons sunflower oil </li>
            <li>1 slice bread </li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1><strong>Steps</strong></h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the sunflower oil in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
