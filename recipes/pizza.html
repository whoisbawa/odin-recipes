    <p>


Pizza dough made from scratch is topped with mozzarella cheese, sauce, and your choice of savory toppings, then grilled to perfection for a fun outdoor treat.

    </p>
<p>
    <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed </li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon additional flour for rolling </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon additional oil for grilling </li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce </li>
        <li>Other toppings as desired </li>
        <li>1 ounce shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h1><strong>Steps</strong></h1>
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li>Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect.</li>
    <li>Brush both sides of crust with additional oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is lightly browned and top looks set. Using long handled tongs, remove crust from grill, grilled side up, to a platter or baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Lightly add sauce and top the grilled side of each pizza crust. Excess sauce or toppings makes the pizza hard to handle. Repeat with remaining pizzas.</li>
    <li>Carefully slide each pizza onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom of crust is browned and cheese is melted. Remove from grill and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
